# Flask-REST-api
David Griffiths's final project for the Udemy course REST APIs with Flask flask_restful and python. 


## About

> 
> [Udemy REST API Course](https://www.udemy.com/rest-api-flask-and-python/learn/v4/overview)
> This app accesses a fictional database for multiple stores and their respecitve items.
>

[API](https://stores-rest-api-dg.herokuapp.com/items) on Heroku.
[API](http://159.65.86.144/items) on a linux server hosted on digital ocean's droplets. Note this site will stop working after March-18 as its not free to host (only for education purposes).

The API allows websites and apps to receive JSON data around fictional stores. This means data retrieval and transformation can be shared between multiple apps and websites, reducing redundancy.


#### Implementation

* web server heroku and created my own linux server (NGINX, uWSGI)
* postman for API testing (GET, PUT, POST, DEL)
* postgres
* flask_restful
* flask_jwt
* RESTful API framework (Resources and Models)
